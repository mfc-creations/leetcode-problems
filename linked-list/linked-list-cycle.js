// Solution: 2
// Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm:
// This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list.
// It uses two pointers one moving twice as fast as the other one.
// The faster one is called the faster pointer and the other one is called the slow pointer.

// Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
// - Traverse linked list using two pointers.
// - Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
// - If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then the linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.

  let slow_p = head;
  let fast_p = head;

  while (slow_p != null && fast_p != null && fast_p.next != null) {
